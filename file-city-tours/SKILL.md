# File City Tours

Create guided introduction tours that help users navigate and understand codebases using File City visualizations.

## Quick Start

### Using the CLI (Recommended)

Tour authoring lives under the Principal CLI's `tour` subcommand. Use `npx` to run `@principal-ai/principal-view-cli@latest tour …` without installing globally:

```bash
# Create a new tour from template
npx @principal-ai/principal-view-cli@latest tour init --template onboarding

# Validate a tour file
npx @principal-ai/principal-view-cli@latest tour validate my-tour.tour.json

# Analyze timing/length against the authoring guidelines
npx @principal-ai/principal-view-cli@latest tour stats my-tour.tour.json

# Available templates: minimal, onboarding, architecture
```

**Note**: Using `npx` ensures you always run the latest version without needing to install the CLI globally.

### Manual Creation

Use template files from `assets/` directory:
- `minimal-template.json` - Simple single-step tour
- `onboarding-template.json` - Multi-step with highlights
- `architecture-template.json` - Layered architecture showcase

## Tour Structure

Tours are JSON files ending with `.tour.json` placed in repository root.

**Important**: Only create **one tour per repository**. If multiple `.tour.json` files exist, only the first one alphabetically will be loaded.

### Minimal Structure

```json
{
  "id": "tour-id",                    // kebab-case
  "title": "Tour Title",
  "description": "What this covers",
  "version": "1.0.0",                 // semantic versioning
  "steps": [
    {
      "id": "step-1",                 // kebab-case
      "title": "Step Title",
      "description": "Detailed explanation",
      "focusDirectory": "src",        // optional
      "colorMode": "fileTypes"        // optional
    }
  ]
}
```

## Tour Content Strategy

### Focus on Concepts, Not Just Structure

**Tours should teach mental models, not just show directories.**

When creating tours, prioritize explaining:
- **What the code does** - Core functionality and purpose
- **How it works** - Architectural patterns and mechanisms (state management, reconciliation, etc.)
- **Why it's designed this way** - Design decisions and trade-offs
- **How components relate** - Relationships between different parts
- **Where to extend** - How developers can build on top of it

**Concrete descriptions beat abstract labels:**
- ❌ "Core packages with framework functionality"
- ✅ "LexicalEditor.ts manages the editor instance and wires everything together - updates, listeners, commands, and DOM reconciliation"

**Show implementation of concepts:**
- Connect architectural concepts to actual code files
- Use highlights to show which files implement which concepts
- Explain patterns like immutability, double-buffering, command dispatching

**Build understanding progressively:**
- Start with high-level concepts ("What is this?")
- Show the core engine/system ("How does it work?")
- Highlight key abstractions ("What are the building blocks?")
- Demonstrate extensibility ("How can I use/extend it?")
- Point to examples ("Where can I see it in action?")

### Key Features

**Focus & Zoom**
```json
"focusDirectory": "src/components",  // Zoom into specific directory
"focusDirectory": "",                // Repository root (entire codebase)
"focusDirectory": "src"              // Top-level directory
```

**Important**: Steps with `highlightLayers` **must** include `focusDirectory`. Use `""` (empty string) to focus on repository root.

**Highlight Layers**
```json
"highlightLayers": [{
  "id": "core-files",
  "name": "Core Components",
  "color": "#3b82f6",                // hex color
  "items": [
    { "path": "src/index.ts", "type": "file" },
    { "path": "src/components", "type": "directory" }
  ],
  "opacity": 0.7,
  "renderStrategy": "border"
}]
```

**Interactive Actions**
```json
"interactiveActions": [{
  "type": "click-file",              // or hover-directory, toggle-layer, explore
  "description": "Click to view",
  "target": "src/App.tsx"
}]
```

**Color Modes**
Available: `fileTypes` (default), `git`, `pr`, `commit`, `coverage`, `eslint`, `typescript`, `prettier`, `knip`, `alexandria`

## Tour Philosophy: Concepts Over Structure

**IMPORTANT**: Focus tours on **what the code does** and **core concepts**, not just file structure.

### Good Tour Practices ✅
- **Explain architectural concepts** - "This uses an immutable state model for reliable updates"
- **Show relationships between components** - "Editor manages EditorState, which contains the node tree"
- **Describe functionality** - "These nodes are immutable - getWritable() creates clones for editing"
- **Connect files to concepts** - "LexicalEditor.ts manages the editor instance and wires everything together"
- **Build understanding progressively** - Start with core concepts, then show how they're implemented

### What to Avoid ❌
- **Don't just list directories** - "The packages directory contains all modules" (too generic)
- **Don't focus only on structure** - "These are the source files" (doesn't explain what they do)
- **Avoid surface-level descriptions** - "Config files" without explaining their purpose
- **Don't skip the "why"** - Always explain why something exists, not just where it is

### Example Comparison

**Before (Structure-focused):**
```
"The packages directory contains the core functionality.
The lexical package has the main code, and lexical-react has React bindings."
```

**After (Concept-focused):**
```
"Lexical's core: LexicalEditor.ts manages the editor instance,
LexicalEditorState.ts holds immutable content snapshots.
Updates use double-buffering - clone state, mutate, reconcile to DOM."
```

## Common Patterns

### Concept-Driven Onboarding
1. **What is it?** - Explain the core purpose and architecture (e.g., "immutable state editor framework")
2. **Core Engine** - Show the main system files and how they work together (Editor, State, Updates, Reconciler)
3. **Key Abstractions** - Highlight the primary abstractions (Nodes, Commands, Transforms) and their relationships
4. **Extensibility** - Show the plugin/extension system and how features compose
5. **See It Working** - Point to examples/playground showing concepts in action
6. **Next Steps** - Resources and documentation, `focusDirectory: ""` for complete overview

### Architecture Tour
1. **Core Concepts** - Explain the fundamental architectural patterns (state management, reconciliation, etc.)
2. **Component Relationships** - Show how major components interact using multiple highlight layers
3. **Data Flow** - Explain how data moves through the system with visual highlights
4. **Extension Points** - Show where and how developers can extend functionality
5. **Patterns in Practice** - Link to examples demonstrating architectural patterns

### Feature Deep-Dive
1. **Feature Overview** - What does this feature do and why does it exist?
2. **Implementation** - Show the core files implementing the feature
3. **Integration Points** - How does it integrate with the rest of the system?
4. **Usage Examples** - Where is this feature used in practice?

### Recent Changes
Use `"colorMode": "git"` to highlight modified files, but **explain what changed and why**, not just "these files were modified"

## Validation

**Always validate before deploying:**
```bash
npx @principal-ai/principal-view-cli@latest tour validate your-tour.tour.json
```

Common errors and fixes are in `references/troubleshooting.md`.

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines
1. **Teach concepts, not just structure** - Explain what the code does and how it works, not just where files are
2. **Connect code to concepts** - Highlight files while explaining the concepts they implement
3. **Explain the "why"** - Include architectural reasoning and design decisions
4. **Show relationships** - Use highlight layers to show how components work together
5. **One concept per step** - Don't overwhelm, stay focused on a single idea

### Technical Guidelines
6. **One tour per repository** - Create only a single `.tour.json` file
7. **Target duration: 2 minutes ideal, 3 minutes max** - Keep tours concise and focused:
   - **4-6 steps** for 2-minute tours (ideal)
   - **6-8 steps maximum** for 3-minute tours
   - **20-30 seconds per step** - Include reading + viewing + interaction time
   - **200-250 characters per description** - Max 300 characters
   - **Total text: 800-1,500 chars** for 2 minutes, up to 2,000 chars for 3 minutes
8. **Use relative paths** - No leading `/` or `./`
9. **Test thoroughly** - Walk through the tour in File City and verify timing
10. **Hex colors only** - Format: `#RRGGBB` or `#RGB`
11. **Kebab-case IDs** - Lowercase, hyphens only
12. **Always set focusDirectory with highlightLayers** - Ensures camera focuses on highlighted area:
    - Use `""` for repository root (full codebase view)
    - Use `"src"` to focus on a specific top-level directory
    - Use `"src/components"` to zoom into nested areas
13. **Last step must focus on root** - Set `"focusDirectory": ""` on the final step for complete overview

## Path Rules

**Correct:**
- `src/components`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `package.json`

**Incorrect:**
- `/src/components` (leading slash)
- `./src/components` (dot-slash)
- `src\components` (backslash)

- **Full specification**: `references/tour-format-spec.md` - Complete API reference
- **Examples**: `references/examples.md` - Ready-to-use tour templates
- **Troubleshooting**: `references/troubleshooting.md` - Common issues and solutions

## Workflow

1. **Create** - Use CLI or copy from `assets/` templates
2. **Customize** - Edit tour steps for your codebase
3. **Validate** - Run CLI validation
4. **Test** - Place in repo root, open in File City
5. **Iterate** - Refine based on user feedback

## Templates

Use as starting points (in `assets/` directory):
- **minimal-template.json** - Quick 1-step intro
- **onboarding-template.json** - 3-step developer onboarding
- **architecture-template.json** - Layered architecture showcase

Copy template, customize paths/content for your codebase, then validate.
